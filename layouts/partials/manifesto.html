                    We believe that the next leap in artificial intelligence requires a deep understanding of the

                    To build truly general-purpose robotic foundation models, we need data that reflects the complexity,
                    chaos, and physics of reality. Not simulations. Not curated datasets. But raw, egocentric
                    interaction data from the perspective of embodied agents.

                    MiriLabs is deploying a fleet of data collection systems to capture this information at scale. We
                    are mapping the affordances of the real world to train the brains of tomorrow's robots.
